Introduction
The goal of this project is to build an 8-bit computer on a breadboard, using basic electronic components, following the SAP-1 architecture. This computer is capable of performing simple arithmetic and logical operations, as well as branching operations. It can execute custom assembly programs stored in its memory.

Components
The key components used in this project include:

Breadboards (multiple)
8-bit Microprocessor (e.g., 6502 or Z80)
EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory)
RAM (Random Access Memory)
Clock module
7-segment LED display
Logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc.)
8-bit registers (e.g., 74LS173)
8-bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit, e.g., 74LS181)
Binary counter (e.g., 74LS161)
Multiplexers (e.g., 74LS157)
SAP-1 Architecture
The SAP-1 (Simple As Possible) architecture is a minimalistic 8-bit computer architecture that includes the following key elements:

ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
Control Unit
Registers (A, B, and Output)
Memory Unit
Clock
Instruction Register
Program Counter
Input/Output Devices
SAP-1 Architecture

Assembly and Building
The construction of this 8-bit computer is carried out step by step, following the Ben Eater's video series. The build process is organized into several modules, which are assembled and tested individually before integrating them into the complete computer system.

Clock module
Register module
ALU module
Memory module
Instruction Register module
Program Counter module
Control Unit module
Input/Output module
After completing the individual modules, they are connected to form the final computer.

Programming
This 8-bit computer can be programmed using a custom assembly language that is converted to machine code and loaded into the EEPROM. Example programs include:

Adding two numbers
Subtracting two numbers
Bit manipulation
Displaying values on the 7-segment LED display
Implementing loops and branching operations
Future Improvements
Potential improvements and expansions for this project:

Adding more memory to increase program capacity
Implementing interrupts and multitasking
Expanding the custom assembly language
Incorporating input devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse)
Developing a custom operating system
Designing custom hardware components
Conclusion
This breadboard-based 8-bit computer project showcases a solid understanding of computer architecture and digital electronics. By following the SAP-1 architecture and Ben Eater's video
